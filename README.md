The Event Manager App is a CRUD application that lets you create events and save them to your account.

You start by creating an account. You can either use the email and password fields and sign up with that, or you can sign in with your Google account. If you already have an account, you can log into that as well. If you're already signed in, you're automatically sent to the home page.

After logging in, you are sent to the home page. If your account is new, you won't have any events created yet, so you'll see a notice saying that you have no events made. There are two buttons that will set you up to create a new event. One is in the center, the other is in the top-right corner. Both do the same thing. There is also the sign out button in the lower-right corner that will log you out and send you back to the login page.

Once you click on a "create event" button, you are sent to the create form. If you change your mind about creating a new event, you can click the cancel button in the top-right corner to be sent back to the home page. This form has two required fields: the event's name and the event's date. All the other fields are optional. When you fill out the fields that you want, there is a "create event" button at the bottom of the page. When that is clicked, the input fields are validated. If there are errors, the fields with errors will be highlighted so the user can correct them. If there are no errors, the event is created and saved to your account. You are then sent back to the home page where you can see your new event.

Your new event will show up as a card on your home page with the event's name, date, and (if available) time on it. You can continue to create more events, but if you click on a create event, you will be sent to a page where you can view the full details of the event.

When you view an event, you can return to the home page by clicking the "go back" button. You can also edit the event by clicking the "edit event" button in the top-right corner.

Clicking the edit button will open up the event form again, but the input fields will be auto-populated with whatever available data you had your event set up with. You can edit any input field, and when done, click the "update event" button at the bottom to update your event. There is a delete button to the right of the header on this page to delete your event. Doing so will remove it from your account forever. If you don't want to update your event, you can select the cancel button in the top right and go back to the home page.
